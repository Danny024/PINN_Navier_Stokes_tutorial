# PINN_Navier_Stokes_tutorial
This is a Jupyter notebook tutorial for the Lid Cavity driven fluid dynamic problem using Physics Informed Neural Networks.

We make use of the Nvidia Modulus Sym library and feed the Navier Stokes Equation Partial Differential Equation to where as definining our boundary conditions to be feed into a Fully Connected Neural Network Architecture
